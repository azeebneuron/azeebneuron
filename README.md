_üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on building a GPT model from scratch <br>
_üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on AI Projects, computer vision, and natural language processing <br>
_üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about Neural Networks, Transformers, and advanced deep learning architectures<br>
_‚ö° Fun fact: I didn't watch a single lecture for web dev<br>
_üë®‚Äçüíª All of my projects will be available at [rahulsingh.xyz](https://www.rahulsingh.xyz/) (Hopefully) <br>
